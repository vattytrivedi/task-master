## Best practices for contribution

Anyone can contribute to our open source project, so feel free to do it. But make sure that you follow certain practices which include:

1. Make sure that git commit messages are meaningful, easy to understand and extremely specific: for e.g. 'Fixed Submit button not working properly on the user dashboard page'.
2. **Each Pull Request(PR) must solve one issue mentioned in our issues page**. In case your PR is solving any bug that is not mentioned in the issues page, then open one issue explaining the bug and then make a PR with reference to that issue.
3. While solving an issue you must make one comment saying that you are working on that issue so that we can avoid any conflict.
4. While making a PR make sure you reference your issue id (#1, #2 etc.) in the commit message or title.
4. Make sure you squash your commit if there are more than 2 commits in your Pull Request. In case of difficulties feel free to ask for any assistance.
5. While making any Pull Request for the UI make sure you attach one screenshot & one link to your version's site showing the final result or the bug which you have solved.
6. While creating any issue make sure you mention all the procedures required to generate that bug/error and have one brief description about that bug.
7. Last but not the least, ALWAYS follow standard coding practices, naming conventions and the regular document object model (DOM).




<b><i>Example of Right and Wrong Approach.</i></b>


Suppose we raise a bug that page is not being responsive. What does it mean?

  We like the design. Do not change the design.
  
  
      WRONG APPROACH: For example: You don't like the fonts, you change it?
      CORRECT APPROACH: Our page is not being responsive, you fix it, with all the initial design, fonts,
                        and colors.

      WRONG APPROACH: You want to add a feature, you just add it.
      CORRECT APPROACH: You want to add a feature, you ask the moderators if they want that, host the
      files in your github repo and submit github pages here in the comments below. After we review,
      you can send a PR request, and we will definitely accept it. :) Cheers !!
      
      
**NOTE:- _Failing to follow the guidelines properly may result closing the Pull Request_**
